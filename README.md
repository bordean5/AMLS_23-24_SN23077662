### Program structure

-- AMLS_23-24_SN23077662

&emsp; -- A

&emsp;&emsp; -- A1.py

&emsp;&emsp;  A2.py

&emsp; -- B

&emsp;&emsp; -- B1.py

&emsp;&emsp; -- B2.py

&emsp; -- main.py : file to run the whole project

&emsp; -- README.md


### Program run instruction

The main function is composed of several sub function and you can solve the task by running main.py

You can run "python A1/A2/B1/B2.py" to run each task. And it can also be done with "python main.py" which 4 tasks will be run one by one.

- For A1 and A2, 
    A1: SVM ,KNN random forest and logistic regression with hyperparameter tuning
    A2: CNN training with a history best model loaded
- For B1 and B2,
    B1:random forest
    B2 CNN
